    "To run these tests, we can open the testing tab in the explorer (the conical flask icon). Initially, VS Code will not be configured to access the tests, so click \"Configure Python Tests\". The tests we have written use the `unittest` framework, so click \"unittest\" in the dropdown box at the top of the screen. We then need to tell VS Code where to look for the tests, so click on \"tests\" to tell VS Code to look in that directory. We need to tell VS Code the pattern of the test files, so we can click `test_*.py` to match the files in the `tests` directory. This has given VS Code all the information it needs to access the tests. This configuration is stored in the file [`.vscode/settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json).\n",

The icons next to the tests will also update to show whether the tests have passed or failed."

Open [`quadratic.py`](quadratic.py) and edit the line inside the first `else` section so it reads `return([c / b])` instead of `return([-c / b])`. Now run the tests again. The test `test_zero_a` should now fail. If we examine the output, we'll see that the test failed because the expected output was `[-1]` but `[1]` was returned. If we are running the tests regularly as we develop the code, we would have been alerted to this error as soon as it was introduced, helping us to find it and fix it.\n",
